# Redirect module

## Introduction

This is Redirect module, an extension for Contao Open Source CMS.  It was
originally written by Jan Theofel (jan.theofel)
[http://www.theofel.com/webprojekte.html](http://www.theofel.com/webprojekte.html).

This is unofficial fork of original extension to support Contao 3 and lator.


## Function

This extension contains five different front end modules for redirecting
visitors:

* SSL Redirect: This is the SSL redirect module by Eric Bartels. Redirect a user if he's not visiting the encrypted version of your website.
* Non-SSL Redirect: This is the opposite, redirecting users to the non-ssl version of your website.
* Login Redirect: Redirect users if they are logged in. You can use this to prevent access to certain sites (registration page, for example).
* Browser/browser version redirect: Allows visitors from eg. iPhone or Internet Explorer 6 to be redirected to a specific page (can be done just once using a cookie)
* OS redirect: Allows internal or external redirects based on the client OS (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, ...)
